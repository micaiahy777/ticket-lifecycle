For this ticket, I made it very simple since there would be no real work done on my end. I started with a fake Karen profile to make it seem like she had a problem with mobile banking for her company. This shows the creation of the ticket that will be sent to my mock corporation.

After "Karen" sent the ticket, I log in with another user to see how it looks on the other side. I am able to make changes, assign the department/SLA for the ticket, and also add any important notes for it. From there, I can send it off, or decide to work it to completion (I later send it to my fake agent Bobby).

While working this ticket, I was able to make notes on what was going on through the process until it was resolved. I could then close the ticket and wait for a new one. This exercise helped me see what the ticket lifestyle looks like from both sides, start to finish!
